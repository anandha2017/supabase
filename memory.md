# Email Form Implementation - Session Summary

## Task Overview
We created a nice-looking form using Next.js and Tailwind CSS based on an email database schema. The form was designed to capture all the fields needed for an email record in the database.

## Database Schema
The implementation was based on the following SQL schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE emails (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,                -- Unique ID for each email
    subject TEXT NOT NULL,                -- Subject of the email
    sender TEXT NOT NULL,                 -- Email address of the sender
    recipient TEXT[] NOT NULL,            -- Array of recipients
    cc TEXT[],                            -- Optional CC recipients
    bcc TEXT[],                           -- Optional BCC recipients
    body TEXT NOT NULL,                   -- Full body of the email (raw content)
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()  -- Timestamp when the email was sent or received
);
```

## Implementation Details

### Form Component
We created a form component in `/app/send-email/page.tsx` with the following features:

1. **Form Fields**:
   - Subject (text, required)
   - Sender (email, required)
   - Recipients (email array, required)
   - CC (email array, optional)
   - BCC (email array, optional)
   - Body (text area, required)

2. **Dynamic Email Fields**:
   - Implemented functionality to add/remove multiple email addresses for recipients, CC, and BCC
   - First recipient is required, others are optional
   - CC and BCC fields are entirely optional

3. **Styling**:
   - Used Tailwind CSS for responsive and clean design
   - Leveraged existing UI components from the project:
     - Button from `/components/ui/button.tsx`
     - Input from `/components/ui/input.tsx`
     - Label from `/components/ui/label.tsx`
     - SubmitButton from `/components/submit-button.tsx`
   - Created a custom styled textarea for the email body

4. **Form Validation**:
   - Added required field validation
   - Used email type inputs for proper email format validation

5. **Form Submission**:
   - Implemented a form submission handler that logs the form data
   - Set up the structure for connecting to a backend API in the future

### Code Structure
The implementation used React hooks for state management:
- `useState` for managing the email arrays (recipients, CC, BCC)
- Helper functions for adding, updating, and removing email fields
- Form action for handling submission

## Testing
We tested the form by:
1. Starting the Next.js development server
2. Navigating to the form page at http://localhost:3000/send-email
3. Verifying the form rendered correctly with all fields
4. Testing the "Add Recipient" functionality to ensure it correctly added new recipient fields
5. Confirming the form's visual appearance matched the design requirements

## Final Steps
After completing and testing the implementation, we stopped the Next.js development server using the `pkill -f "next dev"` command.

## Future Enhancements
Potential future improvements could include:
- Adding a rich text editor for the email body
- Implementing email sending functionality
- Adding file attachment capabilities

# API Implementation and Security Enhancements - Session Summary

## Task Overview
We implemented a secure API endpoint to store email data from the form into a Supabase database. We also enhanced the form to connect with this API and display detailed validation feedback.

## API Implementation

### API Endpoint
We created an API endpoint at `/app/api/store-email/route.ts` with the following features:

1. **Database Integration**:
   - Connected to Supabase using the server client
   - Inserted email data into the existing `emails` table
   - Returned the created email ID on success

2. **Authentication**:
   - Implemented session-based authentication for production
   - Added development mode bypass for easier testing
   - Protected the API from unauthorized access

3. **Input Validation**:
   - Email format validation using regex
   - Required field validation (subject, sender, recipients, body)
   - Content length validation (subject: 200 chars, body: 500,000 chars)
   - Array type validation for recipients, CC, and BCC

4. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Rate limiting (10 requests per minute per IP)
   - Content-Type validation
   - Request body validation
   - Detailed error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes

### Code Snippet: Email Validation
```typescript
// Email validation regex
const EMAIL_REGEX = /^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$/;

// Validate email format
const isValidEmail = (email: string): boolean => {
  return EMAIL_REGEX.test(email);
};

// Validate all inputs
const validateEmailData = (data: any) => {
  const errors: string[] = [];
  
  // Check required fields exist
  if (!data.subject) errors.push('Subject is required');
  if (!data.sender) errors.push('Sender is required');
  if (!data.recipients || !Array.isArray(data.recipients) || data.recipients.length === 0) {
    errors.push('At least one recipient is required');
  }
  if (!data.body) errors.push('Email body is required');
  
  // If missing required fields, return early
  if (errors.length > 0) return { valid: false, errors };
  
  // Validate email formats
  if (!isValidEmail(data.sender)) errors.push('Sender email format is invalid');
  
  // Additional validation for recipients, CC, and BCC...
  
  return { 
    valid: errors.length === 0,
    errors
  };
};
```

## Form Enhancements

We updated the form component in `/app/send-email/page.tsx` to:

1. **Connect to the API**:
   - Added fetch request to the `/api/store-email` endpoint
   - Sent form data as JSON in the request body
   - Handled API responses appropriately

2. **Improved Error Handling**:
   - Enhanced the status state to include detailed error information
   - Added support for displaying multiple validation errors
   - Improved the error message UI with a list format for multiple errors

3. **User Feedback**:
   - Added success message display
   - Implemented detailed validation error messages
   - Improved the visual presentation of status messages

### Code Snippet: Form Status Display
```tsx
{status.type !== "none" && (
  <div className={`p-4 rounded-md ${
    status.type === "success" ? "bg-green-100 text-green-800" : "bg-red-100 text-red-800"
  }`}>
    <p className="font-semibold">{status.message}</p>
    {status.details && status.details.length > 0 && (
      <ul className="mt-2 list-disc list-inside">
        {status.details.map((detail, index) => (
          <li key={index}>{detail}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    )}
  </div>
)}
```

## Testing
The enhanced implementation can be tested by:

1. Starting the Next.js development server:
   ```bash
   cd supabase-vector-db
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Navigating to the form page at http://localhost:3000/send-email

3. Testing various validation scenarios:
   - Submitting with invalid email formats
   - Submitting with missing required fields
   - Submitting with very long content
   - Submitting multiple requests quickly to test rate limiting

4. Verifying the data is stored in Supabase:
   - Check the `emails` table in the Supabase dashboard
   - Confirm that the submitted data appears with the correct structure

## Security Considerations
The implementation includes several security best practices:

1. Input validation to prevent injection attacks
2. Rate limiting to prevent abuse
3. Authentication to control access
4. Content-Type validation
5. Detailed error handling without exposing sensitive information
6. Development mode bypass for easier testing while maintaining production security
