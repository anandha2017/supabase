# Email Form Implementation - Session Summary

## Task Overview
We created a nice-looking form using Next.js and Tailwind CSS based on an email database schema. The form was designed to capture all the fields needed for an email record in the database.

## Database Schema
The implementation was based on the following SQL schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE emails (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,                -- Unique ID for each email
    subject TEXT NOT NULL,                -- Subject of the email
    sender TEXT NOT NULL,                 -- Email address of the sender
    recipient TEXT[] NOT NULL,            -- Array of recipients
    cc TEXT[],                            -- Optional CC recipients
    bcc TEXT[],                           -- Optional BCC recipients
    body TEXT NOT NULL,                   -- Full body of the email (raw content)
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()  -- Timestamp when the email was sent or received
);
```

## Implementation Details

### Form Component
We created a form component in `/app/send-email/page.tsx` with the following features:

1. **Form Fields**:
   - Subject (text, required)
   - Sender (email, required)
   - Recipients (email array, required)
   - CC (email array, optional)
   - BCC (email array, optional)
   - Body (text area, required)

2. **Dynamic Email Fields**:
   - Implemented functionality to add/remove multiple email addresses for recipients, CC, and BCC
   - First recipient is required, others are optional
   - CC and BCC fields are entirely optional

3. **Styling**:
   - Used Tailwind CSS for responsive and clean design
   - Leveraged existing UI components from the project:
     - Button from `/components/ui/button.tsx`
     - Input from `/components/ui/input.tsx`
     - Label from `/components/ui/label.tsx`
     - SubmitButton from `/components/submit-button.tsx`
   - Created a custom styled textarea for the email body

4. **Form Validation**:
   - Added required field validation
   - Used email type inputs for proper email format validation

5. **Form Submission**:
   - Implemented a form submission handler that logs the form data
   - Set up the structure for connecting to a backend API in the future

### Code Structure
The implementation used React hooks for state management:
- `useState` for managing the email arrays (recipients, CC, BCC)
- Helper functions for adding, updating, and removing email fields
- Form action for handling submission

## Testing
We tested the form by:
1. Starting the Next.js development server
2. Navigating to the form page at http://localhost:3000/send-email
3. Verifying the form rendered correctly with all fields
4. Testing the "Add Recipient" functionality to ensure it correctly added new recipient fields
5. Confirming the form's visual appearance matched the design requirements

## Final Steps
After completing and testing the implementation, we stopped the Next.js development server using the `pkill -f "next dev"` command.

## Future Enhancements
Potential future improvements could include:
- Connecting the form to the Supabase backend to actually store the emails
- Adding a rich text editor for the email body
- Implementing email sending functionality
- Adding file attachment capabilities
- Enhancing validation with more detailed error messages
